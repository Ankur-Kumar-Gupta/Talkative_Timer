# Talkative_Timer

A python program which speaks out the current time.

- It is a program created by importing various python packages like 'Playsound', 'Datetime' and 'Google-text-to-speech' packages. 
- Datetime is used to import current date and time even the second to the program. So, from this we only used hour and minutes. 
- After importing current time we pasted it in a text file named 'test.txt' so that our gTTS or Google-text-to-speech can convert it into a audio file. 
- Now as gTTS converted 'test.txt' file into an audio file named 'output.mp3', we only have to execute that mp3 file. 
- Here Playsound package comes in function which allows an audio file to run inside the program without using any external audio player.

To run this program you need latest Python version installed in your system, which you can get from its official website by clicking [HERE](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/). 
After successfully installing python in your system just execute this program, i.e. run that .py extension file
